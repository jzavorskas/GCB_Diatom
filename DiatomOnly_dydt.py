Function: Diatom-Only Ordinary Differential Equation Right-Hand-Side (DiatomOnly_dydt) calculation

  Inputs: 
  
        t : Time value in current loop iteration (hours)
        y : vector of concentrations of dynamically tracked compounds (shown above with units)
        Inputs : a dictionary containing datetime information for light calculation
                 and information about previous flux calculations
        start_date : a datetime object representing the starting date and time, will be
                        changed throughout simulation
        temp : array with daily-resolution sea surface temperature data
        DML : COBRA model structure for diatom-only growth:
                Thalassiosira pseudonana containing all current constraints        

  Outputs: 
  
        dydt : The current rate of change of each of the dynamically tracked values,
                to be sent into an ODE solver.

This file contains the main dFBA framework, representing all calculations that occur during
a single time-step of the ODE solver. Light intensity calculation and Michaelis-Menten saturation
kinetics are calculated based on the current date and time, temperature, and nutrient concentrations.
Based on whether it is day or night, these calculations will be applied as constraints in a different way:
    Day: Photosynthesis is the only carbon source, requiring light, CO2, NO3, and Si(OH)4.
    Night: Chrysolaminarin is the only carbon source, requiring NO3, and Si(OH)4 to use and grow.

This file also diverts to other functions that solve two common dFBA problems:
    1) "fluxCalc" performs hierarchical optimization, guaranteeing a unique solution for all flux
        values used within the system of differential equations. Without this, implicit ODE solvers 
        may fail to converge.
    2) "DaySolve" and "NightSolve" perform solution saving and scaling. Often, recalculating
        the FBA linear system is unnecessary as the fluxes only change marginally, and the active
        do not change. In this situation, one can take advantage of the linear nature of FBA. 
        These two programs scale all dynamic fluxes based on the ratio between the bounds
        of the limiting nutrient (the one whose constraint is active) at the current and saved timesteps.
